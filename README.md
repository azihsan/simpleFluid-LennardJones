# simpleFluid-LennardJones

Hi there!

This is my project for my introduction scientific programming. I made simple fluid 2D simulation based on lennard jones potential. 

All source codes are written with C++ and object oriented programming and I already applied the code on Qt so that will give you nice interpretation on the simulation. 

Any extension of the code would be possible, such as moving the coordinate to the vector template, because i realize vectors class that i made is not so good enough, enlarge the scale to 3D,
applying new potential. 

email me for any interest : ahmad-zainul.ihsan@student.tu-freiberg.de
